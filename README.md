## About

In this repo is my peak energy forecasting research. It is for my internship at PXL for the [Digital Energy](https://www.pxl.be/Pub/onderzoek/Projecten/Projecten-Smart-ICT/33337-Digital-Energy.html?cel=GUID-264A29238D6747228DDEE08063A1F731) project. 

## Features

The research uses the [London dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timmermansjoy/london-electricity-usage-per-household-2011-2014) which is comprised of data from 5000 smart meters.

All of the research is done in the [`notebooks`](notebooks) folder. Here the most used folder is Darts and as the folder sugests the two main architectures that are compared are [N-beats](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10437.pdf) and [Temporal Fusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.09363.pdf).
